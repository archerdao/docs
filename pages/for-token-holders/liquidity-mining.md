When you claim rewards from the Archer DAO App, the claimable SUSHI will be immediately distributed to your account. Details of the vested SUSHI distribution are TBD.

## Vesting Schedule

2/3 of ARCH token rewards are vested. Each time rewards are claimed, a new Grant is created with linear vesting over a six months. Vested tokens may be claimed at any time.

## Claiming Rewards

Rewards may be claimed at any time using the Claim tab in the (Archer DAO App)[]. When staking or unstaking SLP, rewards will be automatically claimed.

## Voting Power

Each staked SLP token provides 32 Voting Power.

Unclaimed and vesting ARCH tokens count towards Voting Power.
